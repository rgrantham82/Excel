## Project 1: Udacity Project

This project involves analyzing a dataset as part of a Udacity course.

**Files:**
- `Udacity_Proj1.pdf`: Project report
- `Udacity_SQL_Code.sql`: SQL code used in the project
- `Copy of Udacity_Proj1.xlsx`: Supporting Excel file

**Description:**
In this project, I analyzed historical weather data, using various SQL queries to extract meaningful insights.

## Project 2: Analyze International Debt Statistics

This project analyzes international debt statistics using SQL and Jupyter notebooks.

**Files:**
- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the analysis
- `datasets/international_debt.zip`: Dataset used in the project

**Description:**
In this project, I explored international debt statistics to understand global debt distribution, key debt indicators, and country-wise debt profiles. The analysis involves data cleaning, SQL queries for data extraction, and visualizing results using Python libraries.
